🧬 Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect human blood groups from fingerprint images. It includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the final model.

📁 Dataset Folder Structure
Each folder in the dataset corresponds to a blood group label.

Blood Group	Folder Name
A Positive	A+/
A Negative	A-/
B Positive	B+/
B Negative	B-/
AB Positive	AB+/
AB Negative	AB-/
O Positive	O+/
O Negative	O-/

📌 Project Workflow
1. Image Preprocessing
Read and resize each image to 128x128.
Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Assign a label to each image based on folder name.
Convert labels to one-hot encoded vectors.
Save the processed data as .npy files.

3. Model Training
Model is trained using 80% training and 20% validation data.
Loss function: categorical_crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Epochs: 10
Batch Size: 32
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

Model Evaluation Loads the trained .h5 model. Evaluates using a validation split via ImageDataGenerator.

Model Saving Final model is saved as: blood_group_cnn_model.h5 Use load_model() from Keras to reload the trained model.

⚙️ Requirements Install the required libraries with: pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
